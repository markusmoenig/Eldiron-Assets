# Eldiron-Assets

This repository contains all officially supported tilemaps for Eldiron. You can use nearly every square tilemap set with Eldiron, this repository just contains the officially supported ones and their JSON integration files.

Each assets may have different licenses.

## Basic

This is the basic tileset which is shipped with Eldiron. There is no need to install these files. I include these files here as they also include various source files which may be of use.
